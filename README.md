A repository where I share delightful devops things that help you do the devops in a funny way.

Text Expander support
----------

The te_snippets folder contains snippets for [TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html) (which is not a free product) for easily adding animated GIF's into your HipChat or Slack or whatever. Just download that file that import it into TE.

The version here online will not always be the most updated with what is running on my own machine, but I support PR's to the snippet file if there are cool other GIF's you think should be added.
